# Network-Analysis-and-Visualization
A workshop on Network Analysis and Visualization

## **Abstract**
This workshop introduces the fundamental concepts of network analysis and visualization, focusing on the mathematical and graphical representation of relationships within a network. Participants will explore the basics of graph theory, including key concepts like density, degree, and clustering coefficients. The workshop will also delve into the practical aspects of network visualization, distinguishing between information visualization and geographic information visualization (GIS). Emphasizing the importance of data visualization, the session will guide attendees through various tools and programming packages, catering to both developers and non-developers. The workshop will include hands-on examples, particularly in social network visualization, using tools like igraph.
